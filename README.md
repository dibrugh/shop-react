# Flow:
1. Create components according to the structure of the mark-up;
2. Styles incapsulated in index.css
3. Implement basic/mvp functionality

# Possible drawbacks:

## Styles
1. No SCSS/css-modules
2. Using 'float', negatives (-n px) in styles
3. No adaptivity
4. Overload of trasform: scale()

## Functionality
1. Can't close modal window by clicking outside
2. Can't add duplicates to shopping cart
3. No usage of storages (al least local storage for shopping cart)
